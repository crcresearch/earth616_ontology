## LLM ODP Template based on ontologydesingpatterns.org pattern documentation structure.

Here's a combined template for documenting Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) that incorporates elements from both templates:

```markdown
# [ODP Name]

## General
* **Intent**: [A concise statement that answers the following questions: What problem does the ODP solve? When to use the ODP?]
* **Competency Questions**:
  - [Question 1]
  - [Question 2]
  - [...]
* **Consequences**: 
  - [Consequence 1]
  - [Consequence 2]
  - [...]
* **Scenarios**:
  - [Scenario 1]
  - [Scenario 2]
  - [...]

## Elements
### Classes
* [Class 1] - [Description]
* [Class 2] - [Description]
* [...]

### Properties
* [Property 1] ([Domain Class], [Range Class]) - [Description]
* [Property 2] ([Domain Class], [Range Class]) - [Description]
* [...]

## Axioms in formal logic notation as a rule
```
[Axiom 1]
[Axiom 2]
[...]
```

## Natural Language Description of Axioms
1. [Axiom 1 in natural language]
2. [Axiom 2 in natural language]
3. [...]

## Related ODPs
* [Related ODP 1] - [Brief description of relation]
* [Related ODP 2] - [Brief description of relation]
* [...]

## Example

This template includes the following sections:

1. General: Includes the Intent, Competency Questions, Consequences, and Scenarios sections from your template.
2. Diagram: A visual representation of the ODP from my template.
3. Elements: Lists the classes and properties that make up the ODP, with descriptions for the properties.
4. Axioms: Formal axioms that define the semantics of the ODP.
5. Natural Language Description of Axioms: Plain English explanations of the axioms from my template.
6. Related ODPs: Other ODPs that are related to this one, with brief descriptions of the relationship.
7. Example: A concrete RDF representation of the ODP in use, from your template.
