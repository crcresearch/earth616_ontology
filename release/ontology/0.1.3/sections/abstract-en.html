<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Defense Supply Chain and Documentation Ontology (DSCDO) provides a formal model for representing knowledge about supply chain networks, processes, and entities. It enables interoperability and knowledge sharing between supply chain information systems by providing a common vocabulary and conceptual structure and supporting documentation providing supply chain provenance.

Key concepts modeled include:

- Supply chain stages such as suppliers, manufacturers
- Products, materials, and information flows between supply chain stages  
- Supply chain processes such as procurement, production, and transportation

The ontology is designed to be extensible to support modeling of domain-specific supply chains and integration with other enterprise ontologies. It aims to facilitate supply chain analytics, decision support, knowledge management, and semantic integration of heterogeneous supply chain data sources.</span>
