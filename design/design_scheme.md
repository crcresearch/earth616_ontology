Our schema diagrams are labeled graphs that indicate OWL entities and their (possible) relationships. Nodes can be labeled by (1) classes indicated by rectangular, orange, solid border), (2) modules – rectangular, light blue, dashed border), (3) controlled vocabularies (DocumentTypes, LicenseInformation – rectangular, purple, solid border), (4) datatypes (xsd:string, xsd:anyURI – oval, yellow, solid border). Arrows can be white-headed without label, indicating a subclass relationship (the arrow between PersonRecord and EntityWithProvenance) or can be labeled with the name of the property, which could be a data or an object property, which is identified by the target of the arrow, which may be a datatype.
