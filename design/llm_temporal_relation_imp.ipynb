enables LLMs to perform sophisticated temporal reasoning by combining semantic modeling with natural language capabilities:\n", "\n", "1. **Oliv\u00e9's Temporal Reification Model**: We implemented the three types of temporal reification:\n", "   - Instant reification (specific moments in time)\n", "   - Interval reification (time spans)\n", "   - Lifespan reification (entire duration of relationships)\n", "\n", "2. **Core Implementation**: We created:\n", "   - Base temporal classes (`TimeInstant`, `TimeInterval`)\n", "   - Reification classes to capture temporal relationships\n", "   - An `Event` class that integrates all three types of reification\n", "   - Conversion to RDF graphs for semantic processing\n", "\n", "3. **Temporal Reasoning**: We implemented:\n", "   - SHACL validation rules for temporal constraints\n", "   - Temporal inference rules based on Allen's interval algebra\n", "   - JSON-LD serialization with appropriate context\n", "\n", "4. **LLM Integration**: We built functions that:\n", "   - Convert semantic graphs to LLM-friendly JSON-LD\n", "   - Create prompts that guide the LLM to reason about temporal relationships\n", "   - Enhance reasoning with the \"think\" tool for complex questions\n", "   - Support multi-event comparison and analysis\n", "\n", "5. **Supply Chain Application**: We extended the framework to:\n", "   - Support EPCIS supply chain events (manufacturing, packaging, shipping, receiving)\n", "   - Model cold chain requirements for pharmaceuticals\n", "   - Capture temperature excursions with precise temporal information\n", "   - Analyze complex supply chain scenarios\n", "\n", "6. **Demonstration**: We showed how this approach enables LLMs to:\n", "   - Calculate precise durations between events\n", "   - Identify temporal relationships (before, after, during, etc.)\n", "   - Analyze participant involvement across time\n", "   - Assess quality risks based on temporal patterns\n", "   -

More specifically, the workshop\\'s time interval is **contained within** the conference\\'s time interval.\\n\\n## Evidence from the Data:\\n\\n1. The conference time interval is represented by the node `_:Nba8422a325194e838a97e9b3cbc65cbe`, which has:\\n   - Beginning: 2025-09-15T08:00:00+00:00\\n   - End: 2025-09-17T18:00:00+00:00\\n\\n2. The workshop time interval is represented by the node `_:Nb8b0aa6d49614e2e9085733a4ff51057`, which has:\\n   - Beginning: 2025-09-16T13:00:00+00:00\\n   - End: 2025-09-16T16:00:00+00:00\\n\\n3. The explicit temporal relationship is stated in two places:\\n   - The workshop interval has a `\"during\": \"_:Nba8422a325194e838a97e9b3cbc65cbe\"` property, indicating it occurs during the conference interval\\n   - The conference interval has a `\"contains\": \"_:Nb8b0aa6d49614e2e9085733a4ff51057\"` property, indicating it contains the workshop interval\\n\\n## Temporal Reasoning:\\n\\nThe workshop starts on September 16th at 13:00 and ends at 16:00 the same day, while the conference runs from September 15th at 08:00 until September 17th at 18:00. This clearly shows that the workshop\\'s timespan falls completely within the conference\\'s timespan.\\n\\nIn Allen\\'s interval algebra terminology, this relationship is classified as \"during\" from the workshop\\'s perspective and \"contains\" from the conference\\'s perspective. These are inverse relations of each other, which is correctly represented in the data.\\n\\nThe data uses proper temporal reification through the `IntervalReification` class to capture this relationship, showing that the workshop is conducted by \"Bob Chen\" (person:speaker2) during a specific interval that is contained within the overall conference timeframe.', type='text')], model='claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=In: 6264; Out: 511; Cache create: 0; Cache read: 0; Total: 6775)\n", "\n", "--- Testing Question 4: Who has the longest duration of active participation in the conference? ---\n", "\n", "Message(id='msg_01CyZYfrn8wrqw1e9QvtqEuM', content=[TextBlock(citations=None, text='# Analysis of Active Participation Duration in the Conference\\n\\nBased on the temporal data provided, I\\'ll analyze who has the longest duration of active participation in the conference.\\n\\n## Temporal Data Analysis\\n\\nThe Annual Tech Conference runs from 2025-09-15T08:00:00+00:00 to 2025-09-17T18:00:00+00:00, spanning three days.\\n\\nLet\\'s examine each participant\\'s active involvement:\\n\\n### Person: Organizer (John Smith)\\n- Has a lifespan reification with predicate \"event:manages\" and object \"event:annual_conference\"\\n- This is a lifespan reification, indicating John Smith is responsible for \"Overall coordination\" throughout the entire conference\\n- The team_size property of 5 suggests he leads a team for the entire duration\\n- Additionally, he announces an award on 2025-09-17T16:30:00+00:00 (final day)\\n\\n### Person: Speaker1 (Alice Johnson)\\n- Has an instant reification for delivering a keynote titled \"Future of AI\"\\n- This occurs at 2025-09-15T09:00:00+00:00 (first day)\\n- No other temporal information is provided about her participation\\n\\n### Person: Speaker2 (Bob Chen)\\n- Has an interval reification for conducting a workshop \"Hands-on ML\"\\n- The workshop runs from 2025-09-16T13:00:00+00:00 to 2025-09-16T16:00:00+00:00\\n- This is a 3-hour interval on the second day of the conference\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n**The person with the longest duration of active participation is John Smith (person:organizer).**\\n\\n### Reasoning:\\n1. John Smith\\'s participation is represented as a lifespan reification, which indicates his involvement spans the entire conference duration (from 2025-09-15T08:00:00+00:00 to 2025-09-17T18:00:00+00:00).\\n2. The predicate \"event:manages\" with \"Overall coordination\" responsibility suggests continuous involvement throughout the event.\\n3. In contrast, Alice Johnson appears to participate only for her keynote speech (a single time instant), and Bob Chen participates for a 3-hour workshop interval.\\n4. The temporal relationship in the data shows that the organizer\\'s lifespan encompasses the entire conference interval, while the other participants have more limited temporal involvement.\\n\\nTherefore, John Smith has the longest duration of active participation in the conference.', type='text')], model='claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=In: 6233; Out: 574; Cache create: 0; Cache read: 0; Total: 6807)\n"]}], "execution_count": null}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["**AI Prompt**\n", "\n", "Ok.

Unnamed Innovator (person:innovator) - Award Winner\\n- **Total Engagement Time**: Minimal documented engagement\\n  - Only mentioned as receiving the \"Best Innovation\" award\\n- **Overlapping Commitments**: None documented\\n- **Peak Activity**: End of conference (award ceremony on September 17 at 16:30 UTC)\\n\\n## Most Evenly Distributed Involvement\\n\\n**John Smith (person:organizer)** has the most evenly distributed involvement throughout the conference. This is evidenced by:\\n\\n1. The lifespan reification indicating \"Overall coordination\" responsibility for the entire event\\n2. Specific documented activity near the end of the conference (award announcement)\\n3. The nature of the organizer role requiring continuous engagement across all conference days\\n4. Management of a coordination team of 5 people\\n\\nThe other participants have more concentrated involvement at specific times - Alice Johnson at the beginning, Bob Chen in the middle, and the innovator at the end of the conference.', 'type': 'text'}]`\n", "- model: `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`\n", "- role: `assistant`\n", "- stop_reason: `end_turn`\n", "- stop_sequence: `None`\n", "- type: `message`\n", "- usage: `{'cache_creation_input_tokens': 0, 'cache_read_input_tokens': 0, 'input_tokens': 8568, 'output_tokens': 684}`\n", "\n", "</details>"]}, "metadata": {}, "output_type": "execute_result", "execution_count": null}], "execution_count": null}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["**AI Prompt**\n", "\n", "Ok.

However, this event should be documented as part of the product history, and depending on specific product stability data, a quality assessment may be needed to confirm product integrity.\\n\\nThe temporal relationships in the data confirm that the shipping process followed the correct sequence (manufacturing \u2192 packaging \u2192 shipping \u2192 receiving) with appropriate handoffs between facilities, maintaining chain of custody throughout the process.\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n1. Investigate the cause of the temperature excursion (vehicle cooling system, handling procedures, etc.)\\n2. Review the product stability data to confirm whether a 22-minute exposure to 8.3\u00b0C would impact product quality\\n3.
