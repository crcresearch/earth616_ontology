    dcterms:title "Defense Supply Chain and Documentation Ontology (DSCDO)"@en ;
    dcterms:description "An ontology for describing supply chain documentation."@en ;
    dc:abstract """The Defense Supply Chain and Documentation Ontology (DSCDO) provides a formal model for representing knowledge about supply chain networks, processes, and entities. It enables interoperability and knowledge sharing between supply chain information systems by providing a common vocabulary and conceptual structure and supporting documentation providing supply chain provenance.

Key concepts modeled include:

- Supply chain stages such as suppliers, manufacturers
- Products, materials, and information flows between supply chain stages  
- Supply chain processes such as procurement, production, and transportation

The ontology is designed to be extensible to support modeling of domain-specific supply chains and integration with other enterprise ontologies. It aims to facilitate supply chain analytics, decision support, knowledge management, and semantic integration of heterogeneous supply chain data sources."""@en ;
    widoco:introduction """
        The Defense Supply Chain and Documentation Ontology (DSCDO) is a sophisticated framework designed to capture and link supply chain documentation artifacts to relevant events and Tradable Resource Units (TRUs). This ontology serves as a comprehensive model for representing the complex interactions and transactions within the defense supply chain, ensuring that every document, event, and resource unit is accurately documented and interconnected.

        Key Components of DSCDO:

        1. **Event Pattern**: The ontology leverages an Event Pattern to model various types of events such as TransferEvent, TransformationEvent, CustodyChangeEvent, OwnershipChangeEvent, TransportEvent, and ObservationEvent. Each event is linked to spatiotemporal aspects through the SpatiotemporalExtent class, which captures the time and place of occurrence.

        2. **Participant Role**: Events are connected to participants through roles such as SourceRole, TargetRole, EquipmentRole, and CustodianRoles (both Source and Target). This ensures that every event is associated with one or more agents (e.g., organizations, individuals) fulfilling specific roles.

        3. **Container and Containment Relations**: The ontology models containers and their types, along with the relationships of containment. This includes modeling the TemporalExtent of containment, allowing for the tracking of resources over time and space.

        4. **Identifier Encoding**: To maintain traceability, DSCDO includes a detailed Identifier framework, encompassing IdentifierEncoding, IdentifierSource, and IdentifierType. This system ensures that each resource unit can be uniquely identified and traced through the supply chain.

        5. **Traceable Resource Unit (TRU)**: The TRU is a core concept representing units that are tracked through the supply chain. This includes QuantityOfMaterial, which is further detailed by Material types, measurements, and units, ensuring precise tracking and management of resources.

        6. **Observation and Measurement**: Observations are linked to TRUs to capture measurement data, such as quantity and quality, ensuring that all resource units are accurately monitored and recorded.

        Knowledge Extraction Workflow:

        The DSCDO is integrated into a knowledge extraction workflow designed to process supply chain documentation. This workflow involves:

        1. **Document Acquisition**: Using advanced OCR technologies (e.g., Azure OCR), documents are scanned and converted into machine-readable formats.

        2. **Knowledge Extraction**: Leveraging LLM AI-driven pipelines (e.g., LangGraph, LangChain), the extracted text is processed to identify and link relevant entities and events according to the DSCDO patterns.

        3. **Triple Generation**: The processed information is transformed into RDF triples, forming a structured, queryable knowledge graph that adheres to the DSCDO schema. This enables advanced querying and analysis, facilitating decision-making and supply chain management.

        Application and Benefits:

        By implementing DSCDO, defense supply chain management can achieve higher levels of transparency, traceability, and efficiency. The ontology ensures that all documentation artifacts are systematically captured and linked to corresponding events and resource units, providing a robust framework for managing the complexities of defense logistics and procurement.

        In summary, the DSCDO provides a comprehensive and structured approach to managing defense supply chain documentation, leveraging advanced knowledge extraction techniques to produce a detailed and interconnected view of supply chain activities.

Because there are situations in which associations are more permanent, i.e. beyond the physical flow of goods (e.g. packing/unpacking and loading/unloading), an AssociationEvent SHOULD be used: (a) when objects need to be associated with a physical location or (b) when the parent object could also be subject to other, more temporary associations (i.e. captured using AggregationEvent)."@en ;

But whereas master data attributes have the same values for a large class of objects, (e.g., for all objects having a given GTIN), the values of ILMD attributes may be different for much smaller groupings of objects (e.g., a single batch or lot), and may be different for each object (i.e., different for each instance)."@en ;

The coordination and integrity of distributed computing requires time synchronisation of EPCIS events conveying sensor data. Therefore, when populating the time, startTime, and endTime field, EPCIS capture applications SHOULD apply established time synchronisation protocols such as IEEE 1588-2008, which provides a standard method to synchronise device clocks in a network.  Note: The eventTime applies to the completion of a business step, not a sensor observation. For instance, for a receiving event accommodating a sensor element, the eventTime indicates when goods were received ' it gives no information when certain conditions (e.g. a specific temperature value) held true. In some circumstances, event and sensor observation times may correspond though (e.g. if a quality inspector checks certain properties of goods).

[[EventSeries]] that included a number of sporting competitions as Events.

The nature of the association between the events in an [[EventSeries]] can vary, but typical examples could
include a thematic event series (e.g. topical meetups or classes), or a series of regular events that share a location, attendee group and/or organizers.

EventSeries has been defined as a kind of Event to make it easy for publishers to use it in an Event context without
worrying about which kinds of series are really event-like enough to call an Event. In general an EventSeries
may seem more Event-like when the period of time is compact and when aspects such as location are fixed, but
it may also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an Event.

The [[ReportageNewsArticle]] type is based on a stricter ideal for "news" as a work of journalism, with articles based on factual information either observed or verified by the author, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.  This often includes perspectives from multiple viewpoints on a particular issue (distinguishing news reports from public relations or propaganda).  News reports in the [[ReportageNewsArticle]] sense de-emphasize the opinion of the author, with commentary and value judgements typically expressed elsewhere.

A [[ReportageNewsArticle]] which goes deeper into analysis can also be marked with an additional type of [[AnalysisNewsArticle]].

      with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents an information update made by a
      locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,
      local government.

For work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#).

The motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org
expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our
usual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490), feedback comments can also be provided in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#).


While this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol), although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover
the kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation.

Several kinds of information can be provided:

We encourage the provision of "name", "text", "datePosted", "expires" (if appropriate), "category" and
"url" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for "category" where possible, most ideally as a well known
URL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\\_coronavirus\\_pandemic" or "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910".

For many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple "[[text]]" summary of the page. It is
unlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.

We expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]], [[FAQPage]] etc. By linking to those pages from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the [[category]] property of the [[SpecialAnnouncement]].

Many [[SpecialAnnouncement]]s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use [[spatialCoverage]] for the region, and [[announcementLocation]] to indicate specific [[LocalBusiness]]es and [[CivicStructure]]s. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both [[spatialCoverage]] and [[announcementLocation]].

The [[about]] property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using [[about]] only
for representing non-location entities (e.g. a [[Course]] or a [[RadioStation]]). For places, use [[announcementLocation]] and [[spatialCoverage]]. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of [[about]] for locations too.

The basic content of [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is similar to that of an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting
[[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed
with the [[webFeed]] property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline [[DataFeed]] object, with [[encodingFormat]] providing
media type information, e.g. "application/rss+xml" or "application/atom+xml".

The properties [[numConstraints]] and [[constraintProperty]] are used to specify which of the populations properties are used to specify the population. Note that the sense of "population" used here is the general sense of a statistical
population, and does not imply that the population consists of people. For example, a [[populationType]] of [[Event]] or [[NewsArticle]] could be used.

schema:StatisticalVariable a rdfs:Class ;

    rdfs:comment "[[StatisticalVariable]] represents any type of statistical metric that can be measured at a place and time. The usage pattern for [[StatisticalVariable]] is typically expressed using [[Observation]] with an explicit [[populationType]], which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each [[StatisticalVariable]] is marked as a [[ConstraintNode]], meaning that some properties (those listed using [[constraintProperty]]) serve in this setting solely to define the statistical variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place or thing. For example, a [[StatisticalVariable]] Median_Height_Person_Female representing the median height of women, could be written as follows: the population type is [[Person]]; the measuredProperty [[height]]; the [[statType]] [[median]]; the [[gender]] [[Female]]. It is important to note that there are many kinds of scientific quantitative observation which are not fully, perfectly or unambiguously described following this pattern, or with solely Schema.org terminology. The approach taken here is designed to allow partial, incremental or minimal description of [[StatisticalVariable]]s, and the use of detailed sets of entity and property IDs from external repositories. The [[measurementMethod]], [[unitCode]] and [[unitText]] properties can also be used to clarify the specific nature and notation of an observed measurement. " ;

For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure)." ;

When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always  possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear.

Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech.

The *speakable* property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:

1.) *id-value* URL references - uses *id-value* of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of *speakable* has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.

2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, e.g. via class attribute. Use the [[cssSelector]] property.

3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the [[xpath]] property.


For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this
we define a supporting type, [[SpeakableSpecification]]  which is defined to be a possible value of the *speakable* property.

Often but not necessarily each [[variableMeasured]] will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and "knowledge graphs". In that case the subproperty of [[variableMeasured]] called [[measuredProperty]] is applicable.
    
The [[measurementTechnique]] property helps when extra clarification is needed about how a [[measuredProperty]] was measured. This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery. 

For example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence". If the [[variableMeasured]] is "depression rating", the [[measurementTechnique]] could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory". 

If there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties recorded for some given data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for each [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding [[measurementTechnique]]. The value can also be from an enumeration, organized as a [[MeasurementMetholdEnumeration]].""" ;

      Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".

Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated.""" ;

Details including regular expression examples can be found in, Section 6 of the GS1 URI Syntax specification; see also [schema.org tracking issue](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/3156#issuecomment-1209522809) for schema.org-specific discussion. A correct [[gtin]] value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a [valid GS1 check digit](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator) and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also [GS1's GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number) for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The [[gtin]] property generalizes the earlier [[gtin8]], [[gtin12]], [[gtin13]], and [[gtin14]] properties.

Beyond <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/ClaimReview">ClaimReview</a>, the Claim type can be associated with related creative works - for example a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/ScholarlyArticle">ScholarlyArticle</a> or <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Question">Question</a> might be <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/about">about</a> some <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Claim">Claim</a>.<br/><br/>

At this time, Schema.org does not define any types of relationship between claims. This is a natural area for future exploration."""@en;

An EventSeries is a collection of events that share some unifying characteristic. For example, "The Olympic Games" is a series, which
is repeated regularly. The "2012 London Olympics" can be presented both as an <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Event">Event</a> in the series "Olympic Games", and as an
<a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/EventSeries">EventSeries</a> that included a number of sporting competitions as Events.<br/><br/>

The nature of the association between the events in an <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/EventSeries">EventSeries</a> can vary, but typical examples could
include a thematic event series (e.g. topical meetups or classes), or a series of regular events that share a location, attendee group and/or organizers.<br/><br/>

EventSeries has been defined as a kind of Event to make it easy for publishers to use it in an Event context without
worrying about which kinds of series are really event-like enough to call an Event. In general an EventSeries
may seem more Event-like when the period of time is compact and when aspects such as location are fixed, but
it may also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an Event."""@en;

Often but not necessarily each <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a> will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and "knowledge graphs". In that case the subproperty of <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a> called <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/measuredProperty">measuredProperty</a> is applicable.<br/><br/>

The <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/measurementTechnique">measurementTechnique</a> property helps when extra clarification is needed about how a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/measuredProperty">measuredProperty</a> was measured. This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery. <br/><br/>

For example, if <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a> is: molecule concentration, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/measurementTechnique">measurementTechnique</a> could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence". If the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a> is "depression rating", the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/measurementTechnique">measurementTechnique</a> could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory". <br/><br/>

If there are several <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a> properties recorded for some given data object, use a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/PropertyValue">PropertyValue</a> for each <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a> and attach the corresponding <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/measurementTechnique">measurementTechnique</a>.

        """The <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/ReportageNewsArticle">ReportageNewsArticle</a> type is a subtype of <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/NewsArticle">NewsArticle</a> representing
 news articles which are the result of journalistic news reporting conventions.<br/><br/>

In practice many news publishers produce a wide variety of article types, many of which might be considered a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/NewsArticle">NewsArticle</a> but not a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/ReportageNewsArticle">ReportageNewsArticle</a>. For example, opinion pieces, reviews, analysis, sponsored or satirical articles, or articles that combine several of these elements.<br/><br/>

The <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/ReportageNewsArticle">ReportageNewsArticle</a> type is based on a stricter ideal for "news" as a work of journalism, with articles based on factual information either observed or verified by the author, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.  This often includes perspectives from multiple viewpoints on a particular issue (distinguishing news reports from public relations or propaganda).  News reports in the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/ReportageNewsArticle">ReportageNewsArticle</a> sense de-emphasize the opinion of the author, with commentary and value judgements typically expressed elsewhere.<br/><br/>

A <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/ReportageNewsArticle">ReportageNewsArticle</a> which goes deeper into analysis can also be marked with an additional type of <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/AnalysisNewsArticle">AnalysisNewsArticle</a>."""@en;

Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech.<br/><br/>

The <em>speakable</em> property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:<br/><br/>

1.) <em>id-value</em> URL references - uses <em>id-value</em> of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of <em>speakable</em> has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.<br/><br/>

2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, e.g. via class attribute. Use the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/cssSelector">cssSelector</a> property.<br/><br/>

3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/xpath">xpath</a> property.<br/><br/>

For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this
we define a supporting type, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/SpeakableSpecification">SpeakableSpecification</a>  which is defined to be a possible value of the <em>speakable</em> property."""@en;

schem:SpecialAnnouncement
    a owl:Class;
    rdfs:comment
        """A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information update
      with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents an information update made by a
      locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,
      local government.<br/><br/>

For work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#">this doc</a>.<br/><br/>

The motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic">Coronavirus pandemic</a>, and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org
expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our
usual <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490">Github entry</a>, feedback comments can also be provided in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#">this document</a>.<br/><br/>

While this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol">CAP</a>, although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover
the kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation.<br/><br/>

Several kinds of information can be provided:<br/><br/>

We encourage the provision of "name", "text", "datePosted", "expires" (if appropriate), "category" and
"url" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for "category" where possible, most ideally as a well known
URL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic" or "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910".<br/><br/>

For many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/WebContent">WebContent</a> type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple "<a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/text">text</a>" summary of the page. It is
unlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.<br/><br/>

We expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/openingHours">openingHours</a>, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Event">Event</a>, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/FAQPage">FAQPage</a> etc. By linking to those pages from a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a> you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/category">category</a> property of the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a>.<br/><br/>

Many <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a>s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/spatialCoverage">spatialCoverage</a> for the region, and <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/announcementLocation">announcementLocation</a> to indicate specific <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/LocalBusiness">LocalBusiness</a>es and <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/CivicStructure">CivicStructure</a>s. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/spatialCoverage">spatialCoverage</a> and <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/announcementLocation">announcementLocation</a>.<br/><br/>

The <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/about">about</a> property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/about">about</a> only
for representing non-location entities (e.g. a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Course">Course</a> or a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/RadioStation">RadioStation</a>). For places, use <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/announcementLocation">announcementLocation</a> and <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/spatialCoverage">spatialCoverage</a>. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/about">about</a> for locations too.<br/><br/>

The basic content of <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a> is similar to that of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)">Atom</a> feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting
<a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a> updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed
with the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/webFeed">webFeed</a> property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/DataFeed">DataFeed</a> object, with <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/encodingFormat">encodingFormat</a> providing
media type information, e.g. "application/rss+xml" or "application/atom+xml"."""@en;

The usage pattern for <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/StatisticalVariable">StatisticalVariable</a> is typically expressed using <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Observation">Observation</a> with an explicit <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/populationType">populationType</a>, which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/StatisticalVariable">StatisticalVariable</a> is marked as a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/ConstraintNode">ConstraintNode</a>, meaning that some properties (those listed using <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/constraintProperty">constraintProperty</a>) serve in this setting solely to define the statistical variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place or thing. For example, a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/StatisticalVariable">StatisticalVariable</a> Median<em>Height</em>Person_Female representing the median height of women, could be written as follows: the population type is <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Person">Person</a>; the measuredProperty <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/height">height</a>; the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/statType">statType</a> <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/median">median</a>; the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/gender">gender</a> <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Female">Female</a>.

Superficial anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure)."@en;
